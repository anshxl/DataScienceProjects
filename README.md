# NYC-Collision-Data
Project Write-up
Dataset: I ended up using the NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, found here:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes/ which contains a wide
variety of information about all recorded car accidents in NYC from 2011 to 2024.

Questions:
1. What are the leading causes of accidents in NYC? Is there a discernible pattern?
2. What are possible solutions to these causes, if there are any?
Ultimate Argument: The analysis and visualizations clearly proved that the leading cause
of accidents is driver inattention (by far), it also revealed certain patterns into where these
accidents happen. The maps clearly show certain roadways more prone to these kinds of
attention which should mean that the driver should not bear 100% of the blame. If the
same kind of accidents are happening in the same location, that means there is something
one can do to prevent it. This could include an infrastructural decision, a technological
advancement, or something as simple as a PSA. These solutions are discussed in the
project poster.

Learnings: I feel this project gave me insight into how the field of data science can be used
in real-world, relevant, and meaningful situations. It is not limited to visualizing results
from a lab, or making end-of-year business reports. With a good grasp of the fundamentals
of data visualization, it is easy to bring any dataset to life. Visualizations not only make
complex data more accessible but also facilitate a deeper understanding of underlying
trends and patterns. I also gained insights into the critical role of data analysis in informing
evidence-based decision-making, particularly in the realm of urban transportation and
safety.
What went as expected: I knew the dataset had geospatial information in it â€“ it recorded
the coordinated of each accident reported. I intended to make maps in Tableau using that
information from the beginning, and luckily, I was able to do the same without any hiccups.
Using maps was the perfect way to visualize this dataset.
What did NOT go as expected: I expected the size of the dataset would also mean lots of
different columns and relationships to find. However, most of these columns would prove
to be redundant or mostly empty. This limited the scope of this project.
Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the dynamics of road collisions in New
York City and underscored the importance of data-driven approaches in addressing
transportation safety challenges. It also served as a reminder of the ongoing need for
continuous improvement and innovation in urban planning and policy-making to create
safer and more resilient cities.
