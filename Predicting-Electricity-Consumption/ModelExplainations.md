# Forecasting Methods Explained

## 1. Naive Forecaster

**What it is:**  
- The Naive Forecaster is the simplest possible forecasting method.  
- It assumes that the best guess for the next value (e.g., next hour’s electricity consumption) is just the *most recent* actual value.

**How it works:**  
- If the electricity consumption at time `t-1` was 100 kWh, the Naive Forecaster predicts 100 kWh for time `t`.  
- It does this for each time step: the forecast always “copies” the last known actual data point.

**Why it can be useful:**  
- It’s extremely easy to implement and often surprisingly hard to beat for very short-term predictions (like predicting the next hour’s usage).  
- It provides a simple “baseline” to compare against more advanced models.

**Example scenario:**  
- If the last hour’s consumption was 120 kWh, the Naive model’s forecast for the next hour is also 120 kWh.

## 2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

**What it is:**  
- ARIMA is a more sophisticated statistical model that tries to capture patterns in how a time series (like electricity consumption) changes over time.  
- It looks at past data points and how they relate to each other, then uses that information to predict future values.

**Key parts of ARIMA:**  
1. **AutoRegressive (AR)**: The model looks at how current values depend on previous values. For example, if yesterday’s consumption was high, maybe today’s consumption will also be relatively high.  
2. **Integrated (I)**: ARIMA uses the *differences* between data points to handle trends or gradual shifts in the data. This helps the model focus on changes rather than just the raw values.  
3. **Moving Average (MA)**: The model also looks at any leftover “noise” or random fluctuations in the data and tries to adjust for it by using past errors.

**Why it can be useful:**  
- It’s a classic method for time series forecasting and can handle trends or cycles if properly configured.  
- It’s often a good starting point for longer-term forecasts (e.g., predicting 10 hours or 24 hours ahead).

**What is Auto ARIMA?**  
- Instead of manually guessing the settings (called “parameters”) for ARIMA, we can let a computer algorithm (Auto ARIMA) try different combinations of parameters. It chooses the best combination by testing how well each setting predicts the data.

**Example scenario:**  
- If we want to forecast 10 hours ahead, ARIMA will look at how consumption changed in the past (e.g., the last few days or weeks), see if there’s a pattern like a daily peak, and then produce a forecast for the next 10 hours based on those patterns.

### In Summary

- **Naive Forecaster**: A quick-and-easy method that just uses the last known actual value as the forecast. Surprisingly effective in the short term.  
- **ARIMA**: A more advanced statistical method that looks at past values, trends, and random fluctuations to make multi-step forecasts. Auto ARIMA helps find the best model settings automatically.

These models serve as a foundation. In practice, we might test other methods (like advanced machine learning) to see if we can improve the accuracy of our predictions. However, comparing any new method to these simple, established approaches helps us understand whether the added complexity is worth it.
