#### **Project Title:**  
**Predicting Time Spent at Home: Insights from the American Time Use Survey**

#### **Objective:**  
This project focuses on predicting the amount of time individuals spend at home daily based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. Using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data (2010-2019), the goal was to engineer meaningful features, preprocess the data effectively, and build robust predictive models.

#### **Key Steps:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   - Integrated multiple ATUS datasets, ensuring consistency across the years.
   - Filtered for primary respondents and prepared data for time-at-home analysis.
   - Addressed data quality issues such as duplicate cycles and invalid activity durations.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created condensed features for demographics like race, household size, and income to handle imbalances in categorical data.  
   - Generated new attributes, such as "Num_Adults" and "Num_Children," to provide deeper insights into household composition.  
   - Leveraged meaningful transformations like identifying weekdays versus weekends.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation:**  
   - Compared three advanced models: LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.  
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning for each model using Optuna for optimal performance.  
   - Evaluated models using RMSE to determine predictive accuracy and reliability.

#### **Results:**  
- **Model Performance:**  
   - LightGBM achieved an RMSE of **3.371** (Â±0.199), making it the most balanced model in terms of accuracy and simplicity.  
   - XGBoost and CatBoost also performed competitively, with RMSEs of **3.355** and **3.360**, respectively.  

- **Feature Insights:**  
   - Household composition (number of adults and children) strongly influenced time spent at home.  
   - Condensed income levels and education categories provided significant predictive power while maintaining simplicity.

#### **Conclusion:**  
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to predict the time individuals spend at home using socio-economic factors from ATUS data. By focusing on robust feature engineering and advanced machine learning techniques, we derived actionable insights that could inform policymakers and researchers alike.

#### **Future Work:**  
- Incorporate post-COVID-19 datasets to analyze behavioral shifts.
- Explore additional models like neural networks for enhanced prediction capabilities.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing time-use patterns across demographics.
